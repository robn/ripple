<h1>welcome to ripple</h1>

<p>
<b>ripple</b> is prototype pure-HTML client for <a href='http://wave.google.com/'>Google Wave</a>,
built using the <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/wave/extensions/wavedataapi/'>Wave Data API</a>.
Its purpose is to demonstrate that a useful Wave client can be built without the need for any advanced
browser features, and to eventually inform the development of a truly accessible Wave client.
</p>

<p>
Its currently possible to use it to search for and read waves, included
images, attachments and most rich-text, and post simple plaintext replies.
</p>

<p>
<b>Getting started:</b>
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click "login" below</li>
  <li>Choose the Google account you use to access Wave (you might not be offered a choice if you only have one Google account)</li>
  <li>Allow ripple to access Wave on your behalf. ripple is not currently registered with Google, so you'll see a recommendation
      that you deny access. Its your call, but we can't do much without access. The access tokens returned by Google are never
      stored by the ripple server; instead they get saved in your browser cookies.</li>
  <li>Play!</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Limitations:</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>There's a bug in the data API that means you can't read some waves that you are not a direct participant in.
  <li>The data API does not (yet) expose the conversation model (that is, the tree structure of blips in the wave) so ripple has to guess when rendering the wave and posting replies. Things often come out out-of-order, but you can usually still see what's going on. Google promise this is coming "soon".</li>
  <li>Speaking of profiles, user profile support isn't available. That mostly means no pretty user pictures.</li>
  <li>No gadget support. ripple does not implement a gadget container. You'll see placeholders where gadgets would normally go.</li>
  <li>Some formatting elements (headings, bullets, indents and alignments) aren't rendered. Its not hard, I just haven't done the code yet. Coming soon!</li>
</ul>
